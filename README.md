# Code to generate the image of a black hole

It was developed in a research group led by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the Observatorio Nacional.

Session 1: Numerical solution of the equations of motion for a photon. Implementation of initial conditions. Concept of the photon sphere and the shadow of a black hole.

Session 2: Implementation of the detector in the form of a flat screen to form the image. Initial conditions and backward ray tracing in time. Restriction of tracing to the equatorial plane.

Session 3: Accretion structure. Simple model of a thin accretion disk. Image recorded on the detector. Optimization and possibilities for code development.
