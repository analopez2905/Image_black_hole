Session 1: Numerical solution of the equations of motion for a photon. Implementation of the initial conditions. Concept of the photon sphere and the shadow of a black hole.

Session 2: Implementation of the detector in the form of a flat screen to form the image. Initial conditions and ray tracing backward in time. Restriction of the tracing to the equatorial plane.

Session 3: Accretion structure. Simple model of a thin accretion disk. Image recorded on the detector. Optimization and code development possibilities.
